# adjust-pci-latency

Adjust PCI bus latency for gaming or pro-audio production

## What

This script, taken and modified from CachyOS, should reduce PCI bus latency
Also see [here](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Gaming#Improve_PCI_Express_Latencies)
and [here](https://wiki.archlinux.org/title/Professional_audio#System_configuration)

In theory, this is better for Gaming as there is less latency,
but the tradeoff is that the throughput of the system is theoretically lower
too.
